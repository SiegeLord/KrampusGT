# Krampus GT

# Plot

On Christmas Eve, Santa is preparing to load his sleigh with presents only to
find that they have been stolen! With his trusty sidekick, Cyber Rude-Olf, he
sets out to return them to their rightful place and save Christmas.

# Controls

Also see `options.cfg` for controlling audio/mouse sensitivity.
- Mouse/Left/Right - Turn
- Mouse Left Button/Space - Shoot
- W/A/S/D - Strafe
- E - Enter/Exit vehicle
- Escape - Quit

# Building instructions

1. Install Allegro 5.
2. Install Rust from rust-lang.org. You'll need the nightly version.
3. Run `cargo run --release` to build and run the game.

On Windows, you can use the pre-built binaries (extracted in the `allegro`
subdirectory). `run_msys.sh` may be useful for this purpose.

# Wishes

This game was created as a Secret Santa gift, and had to implement the 
following wishes:

1. You must slay Krampus for the end boss and save Christmas.

This is done in the final level.

2. Multiple choice for characters would be nice - eg. Santa / Elf / Reindeer 
with different abilities if possible.

You can play as Santa or Rude-Olf.

3. Learn modeling if not too challenging and use an .obj file format 
(exportable from blender or many other 3D tools) - note you don't have to use 
3D in the game. 2D sprites generated from 3D models are fine.

I learned how to sculpt and vertex paint in Blender. I didn't use the .obj 
format, but the often better .gtlf. Most of the graphics are indeed prerendered.
